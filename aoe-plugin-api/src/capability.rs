//! Capability taxonomy and trust levels for the plugin system.
//!
//! A capability gates runtime access to a resource that can affect user data,
//! host state, the OS, or the network. Static contributions (commands,
//! keybinds, themes, ui, status, panes) are NOT capabilities; they are plain
//! manifest sections that need no grant. A capability is what the one-time
//! install prompt asks the user to approve, and what a persisted grant is
//! pinned to.
//!
//! Capabilities are open strings rather than a closed enum so a follow-up issue
//! can introduce a new permission without bumping `api_version`. The host
//! validates a requested capability against [`KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`] at install
//! and grant time, rejecting an unknown one rather than silently granting it.
