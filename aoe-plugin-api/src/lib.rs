//! Plugin manifest types for the Agent of Empires plugin system.
//!
//! This crate is the stable surface a plugin author (and the in-tree host)
//! compiles against: the `aoe-plugin.toml` manifest schema, the capability
//! taxonomy, and the validation rules that gate a manifest before it loads.
//! The contribution sections (capabilities, commands, keybinds, settings,
//! themes, ui, runtime worker) are defined here. Settings and themes are
//! consumed by the Tier 0 registries (#2094); keybinds/commands resolve and
//! graft at Tier 0 but execute only with the runtime host (#2095); ui slots
//! land with #2366; the status section's consumer is the status reference
//! plugin (#2096). Panes are not a manifest section: they ship as a `ui` slot
//! kind (#2432). See `docs/development/internals/plugin-system.md`.

/// Version of the manifest schema and host API this crate describes.
///
/// A manifest declares the `api_version` it was written against; the host
/// refuses manifests targeting a newer version than it understands. Bumped to
/// 2 when the contribution sections and capability taxonomy were added; 3 when
/// the `detail-panel` slot became the dockable `pane` slot (with
/// `default_location`); 4 when the `status` contribution section and the
/// `aoe_version` host-compatibility field were added; 5 when the `screenshots`
/// presentation metadata was added; 6 when a command could declare a
/// client-executed `action` (`ClientAction`); 7 when `icon` and `icon_asset`
/// identity metadata were added; 8 when plugins could contribute composer
/// actions; 9 when the host gained ACP-capability discovery, host-owned
/// session creation / prompt delivery (with the `session.unattended` grant),
/// plugin-private storage, and structured settings widgets (`object_list`,
/// `dynamic_select`).
