//! The Tier 1 plugin worker host: launch and supervise plugin workers.
//!
//! The host runs inside the `aoe serve` daemon. For each active community
//! plugin that declares a `[runtime]`, it resolves a launch
//! ([`crate::plugin::launch::resolve_launch`]), applies the sandbox backend
//! ([`crate::plugin::sandbox`]), and spawns the worker as a child process that
//! speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC ([`crate::plugin::protocol`]) over its
//! stdio. Each worker call is checked against the plugin's granted
//! capabilities and dispatched to the host API
//! ([`crate::plugin::host_api`]).
//!
//! Supervision is the ACP supervision model minus the persistence half: the
//! worker is a child owned by this daemon, not a detached process. There is no
//! socket, no on-disk runner record, and no reattach: a plugin worker is a
//! stateless transformer over a host-owned event stream, so surviving a daemon
//! restart would only strand it with a stale view. The daemon dies, the
//! workers die, and a fresh daemon respawns them. What is kept from ACP:
//! process-group reaping (a worker that forks helpers is torn down whole), a
//! per-worker respawn budget so a crash loop does not spin, and a concurrency
//! cap. The worker's stderr drains to `<plugin-workers>/<id>.log`.
