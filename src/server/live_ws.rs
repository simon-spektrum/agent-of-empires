//! Capture-snapshot live view for the web dashboard (mobile).
//!
//! Mirrors the TUI's live-send architecture instead of the PTY attach
//! relay: the server polls `tmux capture-pane` (cursor folded into the
//! same fork) and pushes ANSI snapshot frames over the WebSocket;
//! browser input comes back as raw bytes and is delivered via
//! `tmux send-keys -H`. No PTY, no `tmux attach`, no SIGSTOP pause:
//! scrollback is just a bigger capture window the client renders and
//! scrolls natively, and the agent keeps running while the user reads.
//!
//! Protocol (one WS per viewer, route `/sessions/{id}/live-ws`):
//!
//! Server -> client, JSON text frames:
//!   `{"type":"frame","content":"<ANSI text>","rows":..,"history":..,
//!     "cursor":{"x":..,"y":..}|null,
//!     "altScreen":bool,"mouse":bool,"mouseSgr":bool}`
//!   `content` is verbatim `capture-pane -e` output for the requested
//!   window: history lines first, the live screen as the last `rows`
//!   lines (trailing blank screen rows preserved). `altScreen` /`mouse` /
//!   `mouseSgr` mirror tmux's `#{alternate_on}` / `#{mouse_any_flag}` /
//!   `#{mouse_sgr_flag}`: when the pane is a full-screen mouse app the
//!   client forwards the wheel to it (as input bytes) instead of widening
//!   the capture window, since the alternate screen has no scrollback.
//!   `{"type":"size_owner","is_owner":bool}`: whether this client holds
//!     the session's size-owner lock. Only the owner resizes the shared
//!     tmux window and may type; a non-owner renders best-effort at the
//!     owner's grid and shows a "take over" affordance.
//!
//! Client -> server:
//!   Binary frames: raw bytes for the pane (keystrokes, escape
//!     sequences, bracketed paste). Dropped in read-only mode and for a
//!     non-owner client.
//!   `{"type":"resize","cols":..,"rows":..}`: claim the size-owner lock
//!     and, if won, resize the (detached) tmux window to the client's
//!     grid. The lock lives in tmux user options so the web desktop view
//!     and the native TUI honor the same owner; it is released (and
//!     `window-size latest` restored) when the owner disconnects.
//!   `{"type":"claim"}`: explicit take-over from a non-owner; steals the
//!     lock even from a live holder and sizes the window to this client.
//!   `{"type":"window","lines":N}`: total capture window (history +
//!     screen). Clamped to [screen rows, MAX_WINDOW_LINES].
//!   `{"type":"cadence","fast":bool}`: capture cadence. Fast while the
//!     client is at the live edge and visible; idle while reading
//!     scrollback or backgrounded. Like the TUI's live mode, the loop
//!     keeps capturing while the user reads (the agent runs on); a
//!     scrolled-up client just asks for a bigger window and renders it
//!     against a stable position via its spacer model.
